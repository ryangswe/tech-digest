name: handoff
description: End a session so a fresh one can pick the work up — record where things stand in the repository (the plan, decisions, a commit), push, and print a short starting prompt that points there. Use when the owner asks for a handoff, is stopping for the day mid-task, is switching topic, or the session has grown long (around 300–400k tokens) or a context-size warning shows.

# Handoff

The repository is the handoff; the prompt only points at it. A file in a temp folder vanishes
with a cloud sandbox and never reaches another machine, and a summary that restates the plan
drifts from it. So write state where the next session will look anyway, then print a few lines
that send it there. If the owner passed an argument, it says what the next session is for:
shape steps 3 and 5 around that.

**Hand off while the cache is warm.** The prompt cache expires after a short idle. The first
message into a cold session writes its whole context back into the cache, which costs more than
reading it: at 400k tokens one cold message costs about as much as ten to twenty warm ones. So
hand off at the end of the day's last exchange, not at the start of the next, and start the next
day in a fresh session that reads only what it needs. If the environment warns about context
size, offer this skill at the next natural break.

1. **Find where the work lives.** The current branch (never the default branch: if you are on it
   with changes, create a branch first), and the plan for this work if there is one: the dated
   plan in `docs/plans/` whose task this session worked on, from the active list in
   `docs/plans/README.md`. No plan is normal for small work.

2. **Take stock**, checking rather than recalling:
   - `git status` and `git log --oneline @{u}..` (or since the branch point): uncommitted and
     unpushed work.
   - Anything still running: background tasks or agents, servers, watchers, worktrees you made.
     Stop what should not outlive the session, and note what keeps running.
   - What is waiting on the owner: a question you asked, an approval, a step only they can do.

3. **Record it where it belongs.** Write each fact once, in the place that matches how long it
   stays true; point at existing plans, issues, PRs and commits instead of copying them.
   - **A decision a later session could reopen** that is not recorded yet: add it now, per
     `CLAUDE.md` (index line and detail entry).
   - **With a plan:** update its `Status:` line, tick finished tasks, and add one log entry: what
     was done, what was learned, and the **next step** as one concrete action (a command, a file
     and function, a question to settle). Keep the active list in `docs/plans/README.md` in step.
   - **A lead session spanning several plans:** keep one handoff file,
     `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<role>-handoff.md`, with `- **Status:** Closed (a record: a handoff,
     not a plan to execute)` in its header. It points at each plan's state and holds only what no
     plan holds: threads waiting on the owner, what is in flight, pending decisions with a
     recommendation, and the hard rules a successor must not relearn. Delete the role's previous
     handoff file in the same commit, so exactly one is current.
   - **Without a plan:** the commit message carries the state. Its body says what is done, what
     is not, and the next step.

4. **Commit and push.** Stage explicit paths, never `git add .`. Work in progress is fine to
   commit on a feature branch; say so in the subject (`wip: …`). If nothing changed but the state
   is only in your head, an empty commit (`git commit --allow-empty`) holding the step 3 text is
   better than losing it. Push the branch; for a lead's handoff file, open a small docs PR. If you
   cannot push, say so plainly: the next session will not see unpushed work, and the prompt must
   say where it is.

5. **Print the starting prompt** in one code block, at most ten lines, for the owner to paste into
   a new session:
   - repository and branch;
   - the model and effort the role runs on, from its agent file or the lead line in `CLAUDE.md`;
   - where to read: the plan and its section, the role's handoff file, or the handoff commit by
     its short hash;
   - the next step, in one line;
   - anything waiting on the owner, and anything left running;
   - which skills to load, by name, if the next step needs them.

   Leave out everything the plan or commit already says. Never include secrets, tokens or
   personal data, even if they appeared in the session.

6. **Finish with one line:** what was committed and pushed, or what could not be.

## Before stepping away

- **Nothing should wake a large, idle session.** A background agent or command that finishes
  after the owner has left wakes its session with a cold cache, and nothing can stop that. Work
  meant to finish while nobody is watching writes its result to a file or a commit and runs as
  its own session or a plain background process; the next session reads the file. Name the file
  in the handoff. (A session deliberately left to run unattended is different: see the kit's
  `docs/workflow.md`.)
- If such work is already running from this session, say so in the prompt, and tell the owner
  its finish notice will cost one cold turn here; the next session should still start fresh.

## Keep it cheap to retire

A session whose plans are current can be retired at any moment. Keep plan `Status:` lines and
logs current at each closeout (`CLAUDE.md` "Close out"), not only at handoff, so the final
handoff is a small edit made while the cache is warm.

Do not hand off what needs no handoff. If the work is finished and merged, or nothing is in
flight, say so: the plan and the history already show where things stand.
